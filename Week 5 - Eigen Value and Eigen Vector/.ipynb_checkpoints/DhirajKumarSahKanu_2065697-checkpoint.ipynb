    "A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.  For example: “Henry likes macaroni,” or “100 is a prime.”  Formal logic deals with the laws of reasoning that apply to propositions.  Logical operations on propositions are not unlike arithmetic operations on numbers.  For example, take the distributive law for multiplication:<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b><i>a(b + c) = ab + ac</i></b><br>Similarly, we can use the notation of Boolean algebra to express general laws of logic.  For example:<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b><i>not(A and B) <=> (not A) or (not B)</i></b><br>\n",
    "<b><=></b>  means “P is equivalent to Q” or “P is true if and only if Q is true.”  The above law says, for example: not (rich and famous) is true if and only if (not rich) or (not famous) is true.  Formal logic is not very difficult: most of it is common sense.\n"
