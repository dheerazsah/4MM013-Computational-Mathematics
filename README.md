# 4MM013 Computational Mathematics

Computational Mathematics is a course that is designed to equip students with the necessary knowledge and skills to solve mathematical problems using computational methods. The course covers a wide range of topics in numerical analysis and computational mathematics, including the use of numerical methods to solve systems of linear and nonlinear equations, interpolation and approximation of functions, numerical differentiation and integration, ordinary and partial differential equations, and optimization algorithms.

Throughout the course, students will learn how to use programming languages such as Python or MATLAB to implement and solve these mathematical problems numerically. They will gain a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different numerical methods and how to use them appropriately in solving mathematical problems.
